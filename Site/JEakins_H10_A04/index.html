        <p class="center">
          Welcome to the one stop shop for all things magic! Come enjoy a
          magical time doing whatever you please, be it training your magical
          knowledge by taking taking a course or just marveling at all the
          pretty colours, we have something for everyone.<br /><br /><br />

        Although only 2 people work at PWN, with the power of magic, one person can become an entire <a
          href="staff.html">staff</a>! With the help of our many body doubles, anyone (above 16) can learn magic! Our
        magical <a href="tower.html">courses</a> can teach simple life improving things like levitation to life changing
        things like how to create a Familiar. <br /><br />

        As a bonus to our infinite workers, we also have great hours and rates (the rates may change once the officials
        find our building though)! Speaking of finding our building, where is it? Technically it's nowhere, but for
        customers you only need to call! See our <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page, when you call or email, a
        request for a portal will be sent for you to accept. Upon acceptance we will immediatly send you to the
        building!

        Despite what everyone thinks, we're not only a magic training ground!
        Not only do we own all magic, we also own all magic items found so far
        as well! We are henceforth glad to present our <a href="shop.html">Shop of Magic
        History</a> !<br /><br />

        Although it may not be the size of your average shop due to magic
        being only recently discovered, P.W.N is still the largest (and only)
        magic shop! There are many items on the shelves, such as the Crystal
        Dragon charm, which gives a high caliber mage a Crystal Dragon as a
        familiar. This item will stay in the shop until a mage has trained
        enough to summon the dragon, we don't know how powerful you must be as
        of yet, but that just adds to the fun! The dragon will go to whoever is chosen.
